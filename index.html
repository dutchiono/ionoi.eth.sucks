                    <h1>Hello from Dutch</h1>
                </header>
                <p>I come from a blue-collar background, and most of what I know comes from teaching myself, taking things apart, and building until they work. I've been pushing hard to break into tech by creating real projects — automation tools, crypto systems, AI agents, and anything else I can learn my way into. I'm not here to watch, I'm here to build.</p>
                <p>I'm looking for work as a Junior Developer or in any other tech role where I can contribute and keep growing. I've got a strong foundation in networking, systems, and sysadmin, and while I may not have a CS degree, I have something just as valuable: a work ethic, a lot of grit, and a portfolio of real stuff I've built from the ground up.</p>
                <p>So, if you are looking for someone who can dive in, pick things up fast, and actually deliver, let's talk.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Personal PPR Token:</strong> Building an equity-tracking token system on Base where I make money = Holders make money. Typical cap table doesn't fit when everyone else puts in what they have, so I'm building a path for equity holders that's frictionless, transparent, and real when the cash shows up.</li>
                        <li><strong>Polymarket Tech Stack:</strong> Building AI agents and scripts to monitor Polymarket data with research and deliver edge detection alerts in real time. Automated market monitoring, cross-referenced odds against outside data, and build custom notification pipelines via Telegram and Google Sheets.</li>
                        <li><strong>Base Chain Intelligence:</strong> Building an AI agent that tracks new token pairs, liquidity flow, whale movements, and rug-pull signals on Base so I can spot one-chain opportunities before they hit the mainstream.</li>
                        <li><strong>Social Sentiment Monitor:</strong> Automating Twitter, Reddit, and CryptoPanic scraping to catch emerging narratives and influencer activity before they move the market.</li>
                        <li><strong>Technical Analysis Agent:</strong> Building an AI agent that runs 4-hour chart analysis for BTC, ETH, XMR, MONAD, and trending altcoins, computing multiple indicators, detecting confluence, and packaging tradeable setups with entry + exit levels, risk to reward, and stop loss.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>🔧 Recent</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>SSHappy:</strong> Building a React Native mobile app that brings SSH server management to Phones. This means executing remote commands (like service restarts, reboots, log checks), viewing uptime, setting health checks, and managing file transfers all from your phone. I was tired of using tiny terminal apps with no saved sessions or pre-built commands, so now I'm making SSHappy in public, the way I prefer.</li>
                        <li><strong>Nebula-R-07 Crypto Intelligence System:</strong> Deployed a network of AI agents that follow my crypto portfolio, automate research, run alerts, and monitor markets. Tailored agents handle Polymarket edge detection, on-chain data from Base, social sentiment across X/Twitter, Reddit, news and even run technical analysis with real indicators.</li>
                        <li><strong>Server Health Monitor</strong> Built an AI agent that watches servers/services via Healthchecks.io, runs custom health checks, monitors resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk), and sends me focused, intelligent alerts when things go down or start trending bad. Tailscale access, Telegram notifications and pause controls for maintenance windows.</li>

                    <h2>🌱 Shipped</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>VMHost Portal:</strong> Created a self-service dashboard and API for integrating VMHost management, automating join requests, granting access, and logging everything for security and tracking.</li>
                        <li><strong>Postgres Backup Automation:</strong> Deployed Python and Bash scripts to handle scheduled database backups, encryption, compression, rotation, and uploads to remote storage. All watched by Nagios and wired to Telegram notifications.</li>
                        <li><strong>Nagios Monitoring Infrastructure:</strong> Built a custom service and host monitoring framework with custom plugins, smart alerting, dashboards, and Nagios integration. It's been watching my production servers since day one.</li>
                        <li><strong>Linux Home Lab:</strong> Set up a full-scale homelab with Proxmox VE, TrueNAS, NAS backups, Samba, NFS, LD devices (Tailscale, Pi-Hole), custom PHP web portals, and automated scripts to handle expansion, busy backups, and event-based workflows.</li>
